# REPET-Python

REPeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET) in **Python** for audio source separation.

<img src="images/repet.png" width="600">

Repetition is a fundamental element in generating and perceiving structure. In audio, mixtures are often composed of structures where a repeating background signal is superimposed with a varying foreground signal (e.g., a singer overlaying varying vocals on a repeating accompaniment or a varying speech signal mixed up with a repeating background noise). On this basis, we present the *REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET)*, a simple approach for separating the repeating background from the non-repeating foreground in an audio mixture. The basic idea is to find the repeating elements in the mixture, derive the underlying repeating models, and extract the repeating background by comparing the models to the mixture. Unlike other separation approaches, REPET does not depend on special parameterizations, does not rely on complex frameworks, and does not require external information. Because it is only based on repetition, it has the advantage of being simple, fast, blind, and therefore completely and easily automatable.

### original

Compute the original REPET.

<img src="images/repet_original_overview.png" width="600">

The original REPET aims at identifying and extracting the repeating patterns in an audio mixture, by estimating a period of the underlying repeating structure and modeling a segment of the periodically repeating background.

```
background_signal = repet.original(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
    
Inputs:
    audio_signal: audio signal (number_samples, number_channels)
    sampling_frequency: sampling frequency in Hz
Output:
    background_signal: audio STFT (window_length, number_frames)
```

#### Example: Estimate the background and foreground signals, and display their spectrograms.

```
# Import the modules
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal
import repet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the audio signal (normalized) with its sampling frequency in Hz
audio_signal, sampling_frequency = repet.wavread("audio_file.wav")

# Estimate the background signal, and the foreground signal
background_signal = repet.original(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
foreground_signal = audio_signal-background_signal

# Write the background and foreground signals
repet.wavwrite(background_signal, sampling_frequency, "background_signal.wav")
repet.wavwrite(foreground_signal, sampling_frequency, "foreground_signal.wav")

# Compute the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms
window_length = pow(2, int(np.ceil(np.log2(0.04*sampling_frequency))))
window_function = scipy.signal.hamming(window_length, sym=False)
step_length = int(window_length/2)
number_frequencies = int(window_length/2)+1
audio_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(audio_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
background_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(background_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
foreground_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(foreground_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])

# Display the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms in dB, seconds, and Hz
time_duration = len(audio_signal)/sampling_frequency
maximum_frequency = sampling_frequency/8
xtick_step = 1
ytick_step = 1000
plt.figure(figsize=(17, 10))
plt.subplot(3,1,1)
repet.specshow(audio_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Audio spectrogram (dB)")
plt.subplot(3,1,2)
repet.specshow(background_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Background spectrogram (dB)")
plt.subplot(3,1,3)
repet.specshow(foreground_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Foreground spectrogram (dB)")
plt.show()
```

### extended

Compute REPET extended.

The original REPET can be easily extended to handle varying repeating structures, by simply applying the method along time, on individual segments or via a sliding window.

```
background_signal = repet.extended(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
    
Inputs:
    audio_signal: audio signal (number_samples, number_channels)
    sampling_frequency: sampling frequency in Hz
Output:
    background_signal: audio STFT (window_length, number_frames)
```

#### Example: Estimate the background and foreground signals, and display their spectrograms.

```
# Import the modules
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal
import repet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the audio signal (normalized) with its sampling frequency in Hz
audio_signal, sampling_frequency = repet.wavread("audio_file.wav")

# Estimate the background signal, and the foreground signal
background_signal = repet.extended(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
foreground_signal = audio_signal-background_signal

# Write the background and foreground signals
repet.wavwrite(background_signal, sampling_frequency, "background_signal.wav")
repet.wavwrite(foreground_signal, sampling_frequency, "foreground_signal.wav")

# Compute the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms
window_length = pow(2, int(np.ceil(np.log2(0.04*sampling_frequency))))
window_function = scipy.signal.hamming(window_length, sym=False)
step_length = int(window_length/2)
number_frequencies = int(window_length/2)+1
audio_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(audio_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
background_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(background_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
foreground_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(foreground_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])

# Display the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms in dB, seconds, and Hz
time_duration = len(audio_signal)/sampling_frequency
maximum_frequency = sampling_frequency/8
xtick_step = 1
ytick_step = 1000
plt.figure(figsize=(17, 10))
plt.subplot(3,1,1)
repet.specshow(audio_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Audio spectrogram (dB)")
plt.subplot(3,1,2)
repet.specshow(background_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Background spectrogram (dB)")
plt.subplot(3,1,3)
repet.specshow(foreground_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Foreground spectrogram (dB)")
plt.show()
```

### adaptive

Compute the adaptive REPET.

<img src="images/repet_adaptive_overview.png" width="600">

The original REPET works well when the repeating background is relatively stable (e.g., a verse or the chorus in a song); however, the repeating background can also vary over time (e.g., a verse followed by the chorus in the song). The adaptive REPET is an extension of the original REPET that can handle varying repeating structures, by estimating the time-varying repeating periods and extracting the repeating background locally, without the need for segmentation or windowing.

```
background_signal = repet.adaptive(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
    
Inputs:
    audio_signal: audio signal (number_samples, number_channels)
    sampling_frequency: sampling frequency in Hz
Output:
    background_signal: audio STFT (window_length, number_frames)
```

#### Example: Estimate the background and foreground signals, and display their spectrograms.

```
# Import the modules
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal
import repet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the audio signal (normalized) with its sampling frequency in Hz
audio_signal, sampling_frequency = repet.wavread("audio_file.wav")

# Estimate the background signal, and the foreground signal
background_signal = repet.adaptive(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
foreground_signal = audio_signal-background_signal

# Write the background and foreground signals
repet.wavwrite(background_signal, sampling_frequency, "background_signal.wav")
repet.wavwrite(foreground_signal, sampling_frequency, "foreground_signal.wav")

# Compute the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms
window_length = pow(2, int(np.ceil(np.log2(0.04*sampling_frequency))))
window_function = scipy.signal.hamming(window_length, sym=False)
step_length = int(window_length/2)
number_frequencies = int(window_length/2)+1
audio_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(audio_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
background_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(background_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
foreground_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(foreground_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])

# Display the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms in dB, seconds, and Hz
time_duration = len(audio_signal)/sampling_frequency
maximum_frequency = sampling_frequency/8
xtick_step = 1
ytick_step = 1000
plt.figure(figsize=(17, 10))
plt.subplot(3,1,1)
repet.specshow(audio_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Audio spectrogram (dB)")
plt.subplot(3,1,2)
repet.specshow(background_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Background spectrogram (dB)")
plt.subplot(3,1,3)
repet.specshow(foreground_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Foreground spectrogram (dB)")
plt.show()
```

### sim

Compute REPET-SIM.

<img src="images/repet_sim_overview.png" width="600">

The REPET methods work well when the repeating background has periodically repeating patterns (e.g., jackhammer noise); however, the repeating patterns can also happen intermittently or without a global or local periodicity (e.g., frogs by a pond). REPET-SIM is a generalization of REPET that can also handle non-periodically repeating structures, by using a similarity matrix to identify the repeating elements.

```
background_signal = repet.sim(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
    
Inputs:
    audio_signal: audio signal (number_samples, number_channels)
    sampling_frequency: sampling frequency in Hz
Output:
    background_signal: audio STFT (window_length, number_frames)
```

#### Example: Estimate the background and foreground signals, and display their spectrograms.

```
# Import the modules
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal
import repet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the audio signal (normalized) with its sampling frequency in Hz
audio_signal, sampling_frequency = repet.wavread("audio_file.wav")

# Estimate the background signal, and the foreground signal
background_signal = repet.sim(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
foreground_signal = audio_signal-background_signal

# Write the background and foreground signals
repet.wavwrite(background_signal, sampling_frequency, "background_signal.wav")
repet.wavwrite(foreground_signal, sampling_frequency, "foreground_signal.wav")

# Compute the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms
window_length = pow(2, int(np.ceil(np.log2(0.04*sampling_frequency))))
window_function = scipy.signal.hamming(window_length, sym=False)
step_length = int(window_length/2)
number_frequencies = int(window_length/2)+1
audio_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(audio_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
background_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(background_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
foreground_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(foreground_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])

# Display the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms in dB, seconds, and Hz
time_duration = len(audio_signal)/sampling_frequency
maximum_frequency = sampling_frequency/8
xtick_step = 1
ytick_step = 1000
plt.figure(figsize=(17, 10))
plt.subplot(3,1,1)
repet.specshow(audio_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Audio spectrogram (dB)")
plt.subplot(3,1,2)
repet.specshow(background_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Background spectrogram (dB)")
plt.subplot(3,1,3)
repet.specshow(foreground_spectrogram[0:int(window_length/8), :], time_duration, maximum_frequency, xtick_step, ytick_step)
plt.title("Foreground spectrogram (dB)")
plt.show()
```

### simonline

Compute the online REPET-SIM.

REPET-SIM can be easily implemented online to handle real-time computing, particularly for real-time speech enhancement. The online REPET-SIM simply processes the time frames of the mixture one after the other given a buffer that temporally stores past frames.

```
background_signal = repet.simonline(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
    
Inputs:
    audio_signal: audio signal (number_samples, number_channels)
    sampling_frequency: sampling frequency in Hz
Output:
    background_signal: audio STFT (window_length, number_frames)
```

#### Example: Estimate the background and foreground signals, and display their spectrograms.

```
# Import the modules
import numpy as np

# Read the audio signal (normalized) with its sampling frequency in Hz
audio_signal, sampling_frequency = repet.wavread("audio_file.wav")

# Estimate the background signal, and the foreground signal
background_signal = repet.simonline(audio_signal, sampling_frequency)
foreground_signal = audio_signal-background_signal

# Write the background and foreground signals
repet.wavwrite(background_signal, sampling_frequency, "background_signal.wav")
repet.wavwrite(foreground_signal, sampling_frequency, "foreground_signal.wav")

# Compute the mixture, background, and foreground spectrograms
window_length = pow(2, int(np.ceil(np.log2(0.04*sampling_frequency))))
window_function = scipy.signal.hamming(window_length, sym=False)
step_length = int(window_length/2)
number_frequencies = int(window_length/2)+1
audio_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(audio_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
background_spectrogram = abs(repet._stft(np.mean(background_signal, axis=1), window_function, step_length)[0:number_frequencies, :])
